Executive Summary: Upgrading Grafana and InfluxDB for Enhanced Monitoring

Background:
Grafana is a powerful open-source platform for visualizing time-series data, often used to create insightful dashboards and monitor various metrics in real time. InfluxDB is a time-series database that’s commonly paired with Grafana to store the data that those dashboards display.

Context:
In our company, we have successfully used Grafana and InfluxDB to develop robust monitoring applications for two major projects. One is the Star project, which was our initial team-driven solution. Additionally, we've extended the usage to monitor automation testers' activities, and we've built dashboards for SonarQube and GitHub Copilot metrics. These additional dashboards are managed by Martin and have become integral to our monitoring ecosystem.

Need for Upgrade:
Currently, the versions of Grafana and InfluxDB we’re using have become obsolete. To ensure we have the latest features, better performance, and important security updates, we need permission to download and install the latest releases of both tools. Given that we’re already using them in our existing workflows, this upgrade will be a seamless way to keep our infrastructure current and secure.
